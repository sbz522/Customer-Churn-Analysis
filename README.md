# Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Customer Churn Analysis using SQL + Python + Tableau

This is an end-to-end project that involves exploratory analysis with SQL, a deep-dive EDA using Python, and building an interactive dashboard with Tableau to present meaningful business insights for the bank.

# Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyze the customer churn rate of a bank and identify the factors that contribute to it. The analysis was performed on a dataset containing information about the bank's customers, their transactions, and their credit card types.

# Insights

The following insights were generated from the analysis:

  * The churn rate is 16% overall, with the highest churn rate being among female blue cardholders earning less than $40k.
  * Established customers - those who have been with the bank for 25 to 36 months - have the highest churn rate.
  * 20% of the churned customers (the vital few) constitute female graduates both married and single, and male graduates who are single.

# Methodology
The project was divided into three main phases:

  * Exploratory analysis with SQL: SQL queries were used to explore and understand the data. Joining all three datasets was critical in answering research questions to     generate valuable insights for the business.

  * Deep-dive EDA using Python: Python was used to drill down into the data to understand the different variables, their datatypes, summary statistics, checking for       outliers, and assessing both data quality and tidiness issues that required data cleaning. Performing a distribution analysis for each variable identified unique       values and variables that showed potential in providing useful business insights. A cross-correlation analysis helped to check for the relationship between             variables and identify variables of interests that can help solve the business problem at hand.

  * Interactive dashboard with Tableau: Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard that presents the findings in a clear and concise manner.

# Recommendations

Based on the insights generated from the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:

The bank should focus on retaining its established and long-term customers in all income categories, especially female blue cardholders earning less than $40k.
Targeted marketing ad campaigns should be used to effectively target our 20% vital few which are female graduates both married and single, and single male graduates.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis shows that the bank can take specific actions to reduce its churn rate by focusing on retaining established and long-term customers, and by targeting female and male graduates, both married and single, who are the most likely to churn. The use of SQL, Python, and Tableau was instrumental in generating meaningful business insights for the bank.
